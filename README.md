Agricultural Loan Analysis Power BI Project
Welcome to the Agricultural Loan Analysis Power BI project repository! This project focuses on insightful analysis and visualization of agricultural loan data provided by the government to NABARD Bank and further distributed by Samities to individual applicants.

Project Overview
This Power BI project aims to analyze key aspects of agricultural loans to support data-driven decision-making. It is organized into three main dashboards: Summary, Overview, and Detailsâ€”offering a comprehensive understanding of loan distribution, repayment trends, and borrower profiles.

 Dashboard 1: Summary
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Total Loan Applications: Number of agricultural loan applications received in a selected time period, with Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) change metrics.

Total Sanctioned Amount: Total amount of loans sanctioned to farmers via Samities, with MTD and MoM insights.

Total Repaid Amount: Track total repayment collected from farmers to monitor cash inflow and repayment efficiency.

Average Interest Rate: Measure the average interest rate applicable to sanctioned loans over time.

Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluate borrower risk by calculating the average DTI across all loans.

Summary Visualization:
Loan Status Grid: An organized grid showing key loan metrics broken down by Loan Status. This includes:

Total Applications

Sanctioned Amount

Repaid Amount

MTD Funded & Repaid Values
